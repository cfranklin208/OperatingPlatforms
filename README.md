The client for this product is The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room already has an Android app for a game called Draw It or Lose It. They want to develop a web based version of this game that serves multiple platforms. The Gaming Room does not know how this environment needs to be set up and they are asking for a software design document to and to begin the development of the game application. 

I was able to create a sofware design document to explain the needs and options in the development of this game. The sofware design document was ecential as it helps you draw out and implement the needs of the code. If I could revise any part of the code it would be the recomendations. I feel I could have better explained the advantages and disadvantages. 

I interpreted the users need as one application that would need to be run on multiple devices. I determined the application would need two versions. One version would run on desktop platforms and one would run on phone applications. It is very important to consider the user's needs when designing because it is the only way to fully satisfy the customer and provide the user experience they are intending.
